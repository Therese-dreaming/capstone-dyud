# HTTPS Setup Guide for Capstone Project

## Overview
This guide will help you set up HTTPS for your Laravel project so that camera access works on mobile devices.

---

## Step 1: Update .env File

Open `c:\xampp\htdocs\capstone-dyud\.env` and update:

```env
APP_URL=https://192.168.1.29
ASSET_URL=https://192.168.1.29
```

Save the file.

## Step 2: Generate SSL Certificate

1. **Run the certificate generation script:**
   - Double-click: `c:\xampp\htdocs\capstone-dyud\generate-ssl-cert.bat`
   - This will create a self-signed SSL certificate valid for 365 days
   - The certificate includes your IP address (192.168.1.29) and localhost

2. **What it creates:**
   - Certificate: `C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.crt\capstone.crt`
   - Private Key: `C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.key\capstone.key`

---

## Step 3: Clear Laravel Cache

Open PowerShell/Command Prompt in your project folder and run:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

---

## Step 4: Restart Apache

1. Open **XAMPP Control Panel**
2. **Stop Apache** (if running)
3. **Start Apache** again
4. Ensure **port 443** is not blocked by firewall

---

## Step 5: Access Your Site

### From Host Computer:
- `https://localhost`
- `https://192.168.1.29`

### From Mobile/Other Devices:
- `https://192.168.1.29`

**IMPORTANT:** You will see a security warning because it's a self-signed certificate. This is normal!

---

## Step 6: Accept Security Warning

### On Desktop Browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox):
1. You'll see "Your connection is not private" or similar
2. Click **Advanced**
3. Click **Proceed to 192.168.1.29 (unsafe)** or **Accept the Risk**

### On Mobile (Android):
1. Tap **Advanced**
2. Tap **Proceed to 192.168.1.29 (unsafe)**

### On Mobile (iOS/Safari):
1. Tap **Show Details**
2. Tap **visit this website**
3. Tap **Visit Website** again

---

## Step 7: Test Camera Access

Once you've accepted the certificate:
1. Navigate to the QR scanner or camera feature
2. The browser should now prompt for camera permission
3. Grant camera access
4. Camera should work! üì∑

## Troubleshooting

### Apache Won't Start
- **Check if port 443 is in use:**
  ```bash
  netstat -ano | findstr :443
  ```
- **Check Apache error logs:**
  - `C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log`
  - `C:\xampp\apache\logs\capstone-ssl-error.log`

### Certificate Error Persists
- Make sure you ran the `generate-ssl-cert.bat` script
- Check that the certificate files exist:
  - `C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.crt\capstone.crt`
  - `C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.key\capstone.key`

### Assets Still Not Loading
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Check `.env` has correct HTTPS URLs
- Run: `php artisan config:clear`

### Camera Still Not Working
- Ensure you're using **HTTPS** (not HTTP)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Make sure you accepted the security certificate warning
- Grant camera permissions when prompted

## About IP Address Changes

**Your IP (192.168.1.29) may change if:**
- Your router restarts
- Your DHCP lease expires
- You reconnect to the network

**To prevent this (Optional):**

### Option A: Set Static IP in Router
1. Log into your router (usually 192.168.1.1)
2. Find DHCP settings
3. Reserve 192.168.1.29 for your computer's MAC address

### Option B: Set Static IP in Windows
1. Open Network Connections (Win+R ‚Üí `ncpa.cpl`)
2. Right-click your network adapter ‚Üí Properties
3. Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" ‚Üí Properties
4. Select "Use the following IP address"
5. Enter:
   - IP address: `192.168.1.29`
   - Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
   - Default gateway: `192.168.1.1` (your router IP)
   - Preferred DNS: `8.8.8.8`
   - Alternate DNS: `8.8.4.4`

**If your IP changes**, you'll need to:
1. Update `.env` with new IP
2. Re-run `generate-ssl-cert.bat` with new IP
3. Restart Apache

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a self-signed certificate for development only!**

- Do NOT use this in production
- Browsers will always show a warning (this is normal)
- For production, use a proper SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt or a CA

## Configuration Files Modified

The following files were configured for HTTPS:

1. `C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-ssl.conf` - HTTPS virtual host
2. `C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf` - HTTP to HTTPS redirect
3. `.env` - Laravel app URL configuration

## Quick Reference

| What | URL |
|------|-----|
| **Host PC** | https://localhost or https://192.168.1.29 |
| **Mobile/Other Devices** | https://192.168.1.29 |
| **HTTP (auto-redirects)** | http://192.168.1.29 ‚Üí https://192.168.1.29 |
